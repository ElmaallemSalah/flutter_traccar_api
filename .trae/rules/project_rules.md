/// 🧠 Architecture Rules
/// - Use MethodChannel for platform communication.
/// - Abstract platform logic behind a PluginBase class.
/// - Keep platform-specific code isolated per OS.
/// - Avoid direct platform calls in public API.
/// - Use dependency injection for testability.
/// - All Dart code must be null-safe and follow Effective Dart.

/// 🔧 Development Rules
/// - Use const constructors where possible.
/// - All public classes, methods, and widgets must have doc comments.
/// - Split long files/functions into smaller units.
/// - Avoid logic duplication across platforms.
/// - Use Platform.isAndroid, Platform.isIOS only inside platform channel classes.

/// 🌐 Localization Support
/// - If plugin exposes UI, wrap all strings with AppLocalizations.of(context)!.
/// - Support Locale('en') and Locale('fr') in example app.
/// - Include .arb files in example/lib/l10n/.

/// 🧪 Testing Rules
/// - Write unit tests for all Dart logic in test/.
/// - Use mock platform channels for testing.
/// - Validate plugin behavior with integration tests in example/.

/// 📈 Performance & Safety
/// - Minimize platform channel calls—batch where possible.
/// - Use caching for repeated data access.
/// - Handle platform exceptions gracefully with fallback logic.
/// - Validate permissions and OS version compatibility.

/// 📦 Publishing & Compliance
/// - Include plugin_platform_interface for extensibility.
/// - Add platforms: section in pubspec.yaml.
/// - Include LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md, and detailed README.
/// - Validate with flutter pub publish --dry-run.

/// 🧭 Modes for Plugin Development

/// Plugin Planner Mode
/// 1. Analyze platform APIs and Dart interface needs.
/// 2. Ask 4–6 clarifying questions.
/// 3. Draft a full implementation plan.
/// 4. Request approval before coding.
/// 5. Report progress after each phase.

/// Plugin Debug Mode
/// 1. Identify 5–7 possible causes of platform issues.
/// 2. Narrow to 1–2 likely sources.
/// 3. Add logs and validate assumptions.
/// 4. Analyze logs and propose fix.
/// 5. Request approval to remove debug logs.

/// Plugin Refactor Mode
/// 1. Scan for bloated files and mixed concerns.
/// 2. Suggest file splits and logic relocation.
/// 3. Apply naming conventions and doc comments.
/// 4. Reflect on maintainability and future-proofing.

/// Plugin Test Coverage Mode
/// 1. Scan for missing unit and integration tests.
/// 2. Auto-generate test stubs.
/// 3. Validate test results and edge cases.
/// 4. Reflect on CI integration and reliability.

/// 🧠 Reflection Requirement
/// After each implementation, write a 1–2 paragraph reflection on:
/// - Scalability across platforms
/// - Maintainability of the Dart API
/// - Suggestions for future improvements
